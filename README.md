# I have written articles on two important topics in TypeScript.

## 1. What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?

### Answer: 
TypeScript's type inference automatically determines the types of variables, function return values, objects, and arrays values. That is a powerful feature that allows you to write more effecience and readable code. It also helps to prevent errors by ensuring that your code is type-safe.

### What is type inference?

Type inference means that TypeScript automatically understands what the type of a variable, function, or expression should be. That is, it is a feature that allows the TypeScript compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable or expression, and you do not have to explicitly specify the type of each variable and expression in your code.

<b>For example:</b>

```typescript 
const x = 10; 
const y = x + 2; 
console.log(y); // Output: 12 
```

In this code, the TypeScript compiler can infer that the type of x is number. This is because x is being assigned a number value. The compiler can also infer that the type of y is number, because y is the result of adding two numbers together.

As a result, the TypeScript compiler does not need to be explicitly told the type of x or y. This can make the code more concise and readable, as it eliminates the need for type annotations.


### Why is it helpful?

Benefits of TypeScript Type Inference
TypeScript type inference provides a number of benefits, including:

- <b>Conciseness:</b> TypeScript type inference can help to make your code more concise by eliminating the need for type annotations. This can make your code easier to read and write.

- <b>Readability:</b> TypeScript type inference can help to make your code more readable by making it clear what the types of your variables and expressions are. This helps others to understand your code.

- <b>Type safety:</b> TypeScript type inference prevents errors by ensuring that your code is type-safe, and the TypeScript compiler can detect compile-time errors at runtime.

### Conclusion
Type inference is a powerful feature of TypeScript that gives developers more security and convenience with less code. It makes TypeScript smarter and type-safer than JavaScript. Therefore, understanding and using type inference well improves a developer's coding skills.
